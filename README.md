# Alfred Snippet Generator

Alfred Snippet Generator lets you transform a spreadsheet (e.g. Google Sheets or Excel) into an **.alfredsnippets** file, which you can then be imported into [Alfred 3](https://www.alfredapp.com/). 

Entirely cross-platformly browser-based (new browsers). Provides a textarea that triggers a conversion/download when you paste TSV content (just select all your cells and copy from your sheet):

## Spreadsheet format

Alfred Snippet Generator uses tab-separated format (TSV) because it's easy to copy+paste it directly from Google Sheets or Excel. Create a sheet with the following columns and add as many rows as you need. This is designed for helping maintain long lists of snippets like emoji or HTML entities, or importing snippets from other systems.

1. **Keyword(s):** e.g. `fox` or `fox,foxface,fox face` (required)
2. **Snippet:** e.g. `ðŸ¦Š` (required)
3. **Name:** e.g. `Fox Face` (optional)

Recommend not to hard-code prefixes or suffixes in keywords, as Alfred now includes the ability to customise these per  snippet group. Locking them in means other users of your snippets can't edit them :(

Include multiple keywords for the same snippet by separating the words with commas. Don't add spaces around the commas or the spaces will be included in the keywords!

[This demo spreadsheet for Emoji and HTML character entities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WsOrbmMU9pmJUmADv-GgPuTMXD2iTioeT-ATIKFg38k/) shows an example of what you  need. To try it out just highlight+copy all cells, then [paste into Alfred Snippet Generator](https://rawgit.com/dhoulb/alfred-snippet-generator/master/index.html).
